## What Are Ankr’s Kava RPC Endpoints?

Ankr’s Kava RPCs (Remote Procedure Calls) connect your dApp, command-line interface, or wallet with the Kava Network. They act as a messenger or blockchain router that relays on-chain information between Kava nodes, dApps, and ultimately end-users so they can execute necessary tasks like transactions, populate wallet balances, fetch ownership information, and much more.

## Benefits of Using Ankr’s RPC Service

Building with Kava is an excellent choice for creating fast and scalable dApps but requires access to the information on Kava nodes to do so. Therefore, Ankr’s RPC solves the following developer troubles:

**Eliminate Complex Node Ops:** Ankr’s Kava RPCs will completely remove the need for developers to set up their own Kava nodes, removing hours of time spent building, calibrating, and fixing node issues.

**Get Leading Performance & Tools:** Ankr’s Premium RPC Plan instantly grants access to the best tools to build applications quickly, including:

- At least 1,500 Kava req/sec
- Dedicated Kava endpoints
- Prioritized requests
- WebSockets (WS) capabilities

**Experience 100% Uptime To Power Kava dApps:** Connect with a cluster of high-performance nodes that holds the information you need to build and operate dApps with Kava chain capabilities.
