# Run Validator Node

This is an updated guide on setting up a mainnet validator. Note that this is a minimal guide and does not cover more advanced topics like [sentry node architecture](https://github.com/stakefish/cosmos-validator-design) and [double signing protection](https://github.com/tendermint/tmkms). It is strongly recommended that any parties considering validating do additional research. If you have questions, please join the active conversation in the #validators thread of our [**Discord Channel**](https://discord.com/invite/kQzh3Uv).

## Installing Kava

### Prerequisites

You should select an all-purpose server with at least 32GB of RAM, good connectivity, and a solid state drive with sufficient disk space. Storage requirements are discussed further in the section below. In addition, you’ll need to open **port 26656** to connect to the Kava peer-to-peer network. As the usage of the blockchain grows, the server requirements may increase as well, so you should have a plan for updating your server as well.

### Storage

The monthly storage requirements for a node are as follows. These are estimated values based on experience, but should serve as a good guide.

- An archival node (`pruning = "nothing"`) grows at a rate of ~100 GB per month
- A fully pruning node (`pruning = "everything"`) grows at a rate of ~5 GB per month
- A default pruning node (`pruning = “default”`) grows at a rate of ~25 GB per month

## Install Go

Kava is built using Go and requires Go version 1.18. In this example, you will be installing Go on a fresh install of ubuntu 20.04.

```bash
# Update ubuntu
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install packages necessary to run go and jq for pretty formatting command line outputs
sudo apt install build-essential jq -y

# Install git
sudo apt install git

# Install go
wget https://dl.google.com/go/go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz (or latest version at https://golang.org/dl/)
sudo tar -xvf go1.20.linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv go /usr/local

# Updates environmental variables to include go
cat <<EOF>> ~/.profile
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GO111MODULE=on
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$HOME/go/bin
EOF
source ~/.profile
```

To verify that Go is installed:

```bash
go version
# Should return go version go1.20 linux/amd64
```

## Install Kava

Install Kava using `git clone`. Note that version 0.23.0 is the correct version for mainnet.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kava-labs/kava
cd kava
git checkout v0.23.0
make install
```

To verify that kava is installed:

```bash
kava version --long
# build_tags: netgo,ledger
# commit: 1fed82f3c5c054900c4a992ad3be47c63f332d96
# cosmos_sdk_version: v0.46.11
# go: go version go1.20 darwin/arm64
# name: kava
# server_name: kava
# version: 0.23.0
```

## Configuring Your Node

Next, download the correct version of the kava node data and sync a node:

https://quicksync.io/networks/kava.html

Note that the current mainnet network is `kava_2222-10`.

### Syncing Your Node

To sync your node, you will use systemd, which manages the Kava daemon and automatically restarts it in case of failure. To use systemd, you will create a service file. Be sure to replace `<your_user>` with the user on your server:

```bash
sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/kavad.service > /dev/null <<'EOF'
[Unit]
Description=Kava daemon
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=<your_user>
ExecStart=/home/<your_user>/go/bin/kava start
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=3
LimitNOFILE=4096

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF
```

To start syncing:

```bash
# Start the node
sudo systemctl enable kavad
sudo systemctl start kavad
```

To check on the status of syncing:

```bash
kava status --log_format json | jq '.sync_info'
```

This will give output like:

```bash
{
  "latest_block_hash": "920E4D32F02CFF8064D26DD7D34C65DC623F4026C65C192BBCD7DBF19AFB5630",
  "latest_app_hash": "442E7E55982109D9F73467EA0E374312B402AE620DEC81CB3441E949ED0D0A29",
  "latest_block_height": "2437",
  "latest_block_time": "2022-05-25T23:07:36.752766828Z",
  "earliest_block_hash": "9D2AF876309BB9174604004A813DCFEE94F4947B08C5BB4C1A042F318488851E",
  "earliest_app_hash": "E3B0C44298FC1C149AFBF4C8996FB92427AE41E4649B934CA495991B7852B855",
  "earliest_block_height": "1",
  "earliest_block_time": "2022-05-25T17:00:00Z",
  "catching_up": true
}
```

The main thing to watch is that the block height is increasing. Once you are caught up with the chain, `catching_up` will become false. At that point, you can start using your node to create a validator.

To check the logs of the node:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u kavad -f
```

## Creating a Validator

First, create a wallet, which will give you a private key / public key pair for your node.

```bash
# Replace <your-key-name> with a name for your key that you will remember
kava keys add <your-key-name>
# To see a list of wallets on your node
kava keys list
```

**Be sure to write down the mnemonic for your wallet and store it securely. Losing your mnemonic could result in the irrecoverable loss of KAVA tokens.**

To see the options when creating a validator:

```bash
kava tx staking create-validator -h
```

An example of creating a validator with 50KAVA self-delegation and 10% commission:

```bash
# Replace <key_name> with the key you created previously
kava tx staking create-validator \
--amount=50000000ukava \
--pubkey=$(kava tendermint show-validator) \
--moniker="choose moniker" \
--website="optional website for your validator" \
--details="optional details for your validator" \
--commission-rate="0.10" \
--commission-max-rate="0.20" \
--commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
--min-self-delegation="1" \
--from=<your-key-name> \
--chain-id=kava_2222-10 \
--gas=auto \
--gas-adjustment=1.4
```

To check on the status of your validator:

```bash
kava status --log_format json | jq '.ValidatorInfo'
```

After you have completed this guide, your validator should be up and ready to receive delegations. Note that only the top 100 validators by weighted stake (self-delegations + other delegations) are eligible for block rewards. To view the current validator list, checkout one of the Kava block explorers:
