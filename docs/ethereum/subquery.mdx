title: SubQuery Indexer
---

Indexers, in a broad context, play a fundamental role in organising and optimising data retrieval within various systems. These tools act as navigational aids, allowing efficient access to specific information by creating structured indexes. In the realm of databases and information management, indexers enhance query performance by creating a roadmap to swiftly locate data entries.

In the context of blockchain and dApps, indexers go beyond traditional databases, facilitating streamlined access to on-chain data. This includes transaction histories, smart contract states, and event logs. In the dynamic and decentralised world of blockchain, indexers contribute to the efficiency of data queries, supporting real-time updates and ensuring the seamless functionality of diverse applications and platforms.

There are several indexer solutions available, each offering different levels of decentralisation, ease of development, and performance for you to consider. These solutions serve as intermediaries to assist in indexing KAVA Cosmos and EVM co-chains.

**SubQuery** is a leading blockchain data indexer that provides developers with fast, flexible, universal, open source and decentralised APIs for web3 projects. SubQuery SDK allows developers to get rich indexed data and build intuitive and immersive decentralised applications in a faster and more efficient way. SubQuery supports 150+ ecosystems including KAVA, Cosmos, Ethereum, Near, Polygon, Polkadot, Algorand, and Avalanche.

Another one of SubQuery's competitive advantages is the ability to aggregate data not only within a chain but across multiple blockchains all within a single project. This allows the creation of feature-rich dashboard analytics and multi-chain block scanners. Other advantages include superior performance with multiple RPC endpoint configurations, multi-worker capabilities and a configurable caching architecture.

## Running and Hosting your KAVA SubQuery APIs

SubQuery is open-source, meaning you have the freedom to run it in the following three ways:

- Locally on your own computer (or a cloud provider of your choosing), [view the instructions on how to run SubQuery Locally](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/run.html).
- You can publish it to SubQuery's enterprise-level [Managed Service](https://managedservice.subquery.network/), where we'll host your SubQuery project in production ready services for mission critical data with zero-downtime blue/green deployments. There even is a generous free tier. [Find out how](https://academy.subquery.network/run_publish/publish.html).
- You can publish it to the decentralised [SubQuery Network](https://subquery.network/network), the most open, performant, reliable, and scalable data service for dApp developers. The SubQuery Network indexes and services data to the global community in an incentivised and verifiable way and supports KAVA from launch.
