# Contract Verification

Once you have deployed your smart contracts, you can verify them on the
[explorer]. The following guide uses [hardhat].

## Via Flattened Source Code

1. Use the following command to get a flattened source code of your smart contract:

```bash
npx hardhat flatten path/to/your/contract.sol
```

2. [Find your deployed contract on the Kava explorer and follow the steps to verify][blockscout-verify].
   If your contract has constructor arguments, ensure that you provide them in
   the form. If you do not already have an ABI-encoded version of it, you can
   use this [online ABI encoding tool](https://abi.hashex.org/) to manually
   create it. Additional information about ABI-Encoded constructor arguments can
   be found on the [Blockscout documentation][blockscout-abi-constructor].

## Via Hardhat Verification Plugin

You can also verify directly from your Hardhat development environment. This
requires the [`hardhat-etherscan`][hardhat-etherscan] plugin. The Kava explorer uses [BlockScout]
which is compatible with the Hardhat Etherscan plugin.

1. [Install the Hardhat Etherscan plugin][hardhat-etherscan], ensuring
   that the version is `v3.1.0` or higher.
2. Ensure your `hardhat.config.js` file includes the following `etherscan`
   configuration:

```js title="hardhat.config.js"
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    kava: {
      url: 'https://evm.kava.io',
    },
  },
  // highlight-start
  etherscan: {
    apiKey: {
      kava: "api key is not required by the Kava explorer, but can't be empty",
    },
    customChains: [
      {
        network: 'kava',
        chainId: 2222,
        urls: {
          apiURL: 'https://explorer.kava.io/api',
          browserURL: 'https://explorer.kava.io',
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  // highlight-end
};
```

3. Verify that the custom network is configured correctly, by checking if kava
   is listed in the supported custom networks.

```bash
$ npx hardhat verify --list-networks

Networks supported by hardhat-etherscan:

...

Custom networks added by you or by plugins:

╔═════════╤══════════╗
║ network │ chain id ║
╟─────────┼──────────╢
║ kava    │ 2222     ║
╚═════════╧══════════╝
```

4. Verify the contract with `npx hardhat verify`. This may take a few minutes.
   The following is an example of verifying an WKAVA contract.

```bash
$ npx hardhat verify --network kava 0x52A87b0703C65a4C30657e7badc808855711CdEc

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common errors and things to look out for when verifying your
contracts.

### `Bytecode does not match, please try again.`

Ensure the following options are the exact same as what you deployed with, then
try again.

- Compiler version
- Optimization runs
- ABI-encoded constructur arguments

### `There was an error compiling your contract: Multiple SPDX license identifiers found in source file`

Flattening your contracts may sometimes merge multiple dependent contracts also
with SPX identifiers (e.g. `// SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0`).

Remove all SPDX comments except one in your flattened file and try verifying
again. Alternatively, use the hardhat verification plugin to preserve license
identifiers.
