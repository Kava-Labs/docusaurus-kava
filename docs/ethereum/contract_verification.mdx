# Contract Verification

Once you have deployed your smart contracts, you can verify them on the
[explorer]. The following guides use [hardhat]

## Via Flattened Source Code

1. Use the following command to get a flattened source code of your smart contract:

```bash
npx hardhat flatten path/to/your/contract.sol
```

2. [Find your deployed contract on the Kava explorer and follow the steps to verify][blockscout-verify]

## Via Hardhat Verification Plugin

You can also verify directly from your Hardhat development environment. This
requires the [`hardhat-etherscan`][hardhat-etherscan] plugin. The Kava explorer uses [BlockScout]
which is compatible with the Hardhat Etherscan plugin.

1. [Install the Hardhat Etherscan plugin][hardhat-etherscan], ensuring
   that the version is `v3.1.0` or higher.
2. Add the following configuration to your `hardhat.config.js` file:

```js
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    kava: {
      url: "http://127.0.0.1:8545",
      ...
    },
  },
  etherscan: {
    // The Kava explorer does not require an API key but some value is still
    // required by the plugin. This can be any arbitrary string.
    apiKey: "meow",
    customChains: [
      {
        network: "kava",
        chainId: 2222,
        urls: {
          apiURL: "https://explorer.kava.io/api",
          browserURL: "https://explorer.kava.io"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

3. Verify that the custom network is configured correctly.

```bash
$ npx hardhat verify --list-networks

Networks supported by hardhat-etherscan:

Custom networks added by you or by plugins:
