# RedStone Oracles

RedStone delivers frequently updated, reliable, and diverse data feeds to your dApp. RedStone is unique in several ways, with three key aspects standing out:

- **RedStone provides price feeds for new in-demand assets.**  
  RedStone quickly launches unavailable price feeds for new assets like LSTs, LRTs, Bitcoin LSTs, and new types of stablecoins. They are the leading oracle for yield-bearing assets and offer different types of price feeds, including Market Price, Fundamental Contract Ratio, Net Asset Value/Proof of Reserves, and others.

- **RedStone’s price feeds are relied on by the most trusted lending markets in the space.**  
  RedStone secures billions of dollars across mainnets. Protocols like Pendle, Venus, Morpho, Silo, Gearbox, LayerBank, and Euler rely on RedStone’s price feeds to secure their users' funds. An extensive list of our clients can be found [here](https://redstone.finance/clients).

- **RedStone takes a security-first approach.**  
  RedStone has never experienced a mispricing event. It provides the deepest price discovery on the market, infrastructure redundancy, heavy-duty monitoring, and regular audits to keep users' funds secure. They are a tech-first team, consisting of seasoned engineers with plenty of PhDs in Computer Science, Cryptography, and Mathematics.

## RedStone Models

RedStone Oracles operates two distinct oracle models: the [Push Model](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/get-started/models/redstone-push/) and the [Pull Model](https://docs.redstone.finance/docs/get-started/models/redstone-pull/).

- **Push Model**: You can explore the available data feeds for the Push Model [here](https://app.redstone.finance/app/feeds/).
- **Pull Model**: The data feeds for the Pull Model can be found [here](https://app.redstone.finance/app/pull-model/redstone-primary-prod/).

For a live demonstration of RedStone’s price feeds, visit the demo page [here](https://app.redstone.finance/app/tokens/).

## How to Integrate The RedStone Push Model

The RedStone Push model ensures that data is pushed into on-chain storage via a relayer. It is designed for protocols compatible with the traditional Push Oracle model that require full control of the data sources and update conditions (heartbeat and deviation threshold).

The on-chain contracts in The Push Model enable storing prices and accessing them through a familiar interface (e.g., the Chainlink AggregatorV3).

## How to Integrate The RedStone Pull Model

The RedStone Pull Model allows your dApp to utilize data feeds delivered "on-demand," meaning the data is only fetched when needed by the dApp. By integrating the EVM-connector library and extending your use of Ethers.js, your dApp can attach signed data packages with timestamps to the call data of user transactions.

In order to implement The Pull Model, you will need to do two things:

1. Adjust the Javascript code of your dApp to inject the additional payload with signed data feeds to the call data of your users’ transactions.
2. Adjust your smart contracts to include the libraries responsible for data extraction from call data and signature verification.

Please see the specific steps and ready code samples [here](https://github.com/redstone-finance/redstone-evm-examples).
