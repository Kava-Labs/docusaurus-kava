A hosted [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/en/) node is available to use on Kava EVM.

- JSON-RPC Admin (Deploy subgraphs): https://the-graph-admin.kava.io
- GraphQL HTTP Server (Query subgraphs): https://the-graph.kava.io

[An example deployed subgraph](https://the-graph.evm-alpha.kava.io/subgraphs/name/Kava-Labs/v2-uniswap/graphql) is available for V2 Uniswap on Kava EVM Testnet.

# Deploying Subgraphs

### Install graph-cli

https://github.com/graphprotocol/graph-cli#installation

### Write your subgraph

See https://thegraph.com/docs/en/developer/create-subgraph-hosted/.

You can also use an example project like [v2-uniswap](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-subgraph).

### Upgrade the manifest

Update the `network` properties in the `subgraph.yaml` manifest file.
The network name for Kava EVM is `kava-evm`.

### Create your subgraph

```bash
graph create <subgraph-name> --node https://the-graph-admin.kava.io
```

### Deploy your subgraph

```bash
graph deploy <subgraph-name> --debug --ipfs https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/ --node https://the-graph-admin.kava.io
```

Note that you can either use your own ipfs node here or `https://api.thegraph.com/ipfs/`.

Once deployed, your graph should now be deployed and accessible via the GraphQL Server. It can be access at `https://the-graph.kava.io/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>/graphql`.
