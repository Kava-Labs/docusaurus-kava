# Run Validator Node

This is an updated guide on setting up a mainnet validator once Kava Node is setup using the process outlined in [Node Setup Guide](./node-setup-guide). Note that this is a minimal guide and does not cover more advanced topics like [sentry node architecture](https://github.com/stakefish/cosmos-validator-design) and [double signing protection](https://github.com/tendermint/tmkms). It is strongly recommended that any parties considering validating do additional research. If you have questions, please join the active conversation in the #validators thread of our [**Discord Channel**](https://discord.com/invite/kQzh3Uv).

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have a Kava node setup and syncing

#### To check on the status of syncing:

```bash
kava status --log_format json | jq '.sync_info'
```

This will give output like:

```bash
{
 "latest_block_hash": "920E4D32F02CFF8064D26DD7D34C65DC623F4026C65C192BBCD7DBF19AFB5630",
 "latest_app_hash": "442E7E55982109D9F73467EA0E374312B402AE620DEC81CB3441E949ED0D0A29",
 "latest_block_height": "2437",
 "latest_block_time": "2022-05-25T23:07:36.752766828Z",
 "earliest_block_hash": "9D2AF876309BB9174604004A813DCFEE94F4947B08C5BB4C1A042F318488851E",
 "earliest_app_hash": "E3B0C44298FC1C149AFBF4C8996FB92427AE41E4649B934CA495991B7852B855",
 "earliest_block_height": "1",
 "earliest_block_time": "2022-05-25T17:00:00Z",
 "catching_up": true
}
```

The main thing to watch is that the block height is increasing. Once you are caught up with the chain, `catching_up` will become false. At that point, you can start using your node to create a validator.

## Creating a Validator

First, create a wallet, which will give you a private key / public key pair for your node.

```bash
# Replace <your-key-name> with a name for your key that you will remember
kava keys add <your-key-name>
# To see a list of wallets on your node
kava keys list
```

**Be sure to write down the mnemonic for your wallet and store it securely. Losing your mnemonic could result in the irrecoverable loss of KAVA tokens.**

To see the options when creating a validator:

```bash
kava tx staking create-validator -h
```

An example of creating a validator with 50KAVA self-delegation and 10% commission:

```bash
# Replace <key_name> with the key you created previously
kava tx staking create-validator \
--amount=50000000ukava \
--pubkey=$(kava tendermint show-validator) \
--moniker="choose moniker" \
--website="optional website for your validator" \
--details="optional details for your validator" \
--commission-rate="0.10" \
--commission-max-rate="0.20" \
--commission-max-change-rate="0.01" \
--min-self-delegation="1" \
--from=<your-key-name> \
--chain-id=kava_2222-10 \
--gas=auto \
--gas-adjustment=1.4
```

To check on the status of your validator:

```bash
kava status --log_format json | jq '.ValidatorInfo'
```

After you have completed this guide, your validator should be up and ready to receive delegations. Note that only the top 100 validators by weighted stake (self-delegations + other delegations) are eligible for block rewards. To view the current validator list, checkout one of the Kava block explorers:
