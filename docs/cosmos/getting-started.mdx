# Getting Started

This document will help you get a kava network up and running locally on your machine. It uses a CLI tool call `kvtool` that manages the configuration and initial setup of a network. The tool uses docker containers to run a Kava network with some optional configuration.

You must have the following tools:

1. [Go 1.18](https://golang.org/doc/install) - used to build & install `kvtool`
2. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) - used by `kvtool` to run local networks.

## Ensure Go is setup in your PATH

Once Go & Docker are installed, update your bash_profile to include the go path.

```
export PATH=/usr/local/go/bin:$PATH
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:$PATH
export GOPATH=$HOME/go
export GO111MODULE=on
```

Make sure to source your bash profile or restart it for the changes to take place.

## Getting The Kava Repository & Development Tools

Once you have the core tools installed & set up, its now time to get the following repositories from Github:

- [kava](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kava)
  - Main Kava Repo that holds all modules
- [kvtool](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kvtool)
  - Dev tools to interact with a Kava node

## Set Up a Local Blockchain

Now that you have set up all the tools & repositories in your local machine its finally time to set up a local blockchain.

- Open a terminal and change into the `kvtool` directory.
- Ensure Docker is running.
- Run `make install` in your terminal which will install `kvtool` in your machine.
- Run `kvtool testnet bootstrap`. By default, this command will initialize a docker container running the code of the current master branch of `kava`.

Kava is now running on your local machine! The endpoints are publically exposed to your localhost:

- RPC: http://localhost:26657
- REST: http://localhost:1317
- GRPC: http://localhost:9090
- GRPC Websocket: http://localhost:9091
- EVM JSON-RPC: http://localhost:8545
- EVM Websocket: http://localhost:8546

To interact with the network you can use `kava` CLI from your local machine by setting the `--node` flag:

```
kava --node http://localhost:26657 status
```

However, it is likely more convenient to run the `kava` CLI directly in the container. This ensures you are running a compatible version of the CLI and gives you access to the accounts configured in the local chain. To do this, add the following alias:

```bash
alias dkava='docker exec -it generated_kavanode_1 kava'
```

Note that for some architectures or docker versions, the containers are generated with hyphens (`-`) instead of underscores (`_`).

This alias execs into the container and runs `kava`. From there you have access to accounts.

**NOTE**: Before Kava 9 (`v0.16`), the `kava` binary was two separate binaries. One for running the chain (`kvd`) and a separate one for the cli (`kvcli`). If running older versions, you will need to use `kvcli` instead of `kava`.

**Example**:
Create a new account & fund it:

```
$ dkava keys add my-test-account

- name: my-test-account
  type: local
  address: kava17fuj33p6y472j3kplsjdz966xlw6cdhwqzl8rl
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"AnaP5cFfUDcK4jOGTLPCUPGqtijViYmCAd7XRg7XTQib"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

$ dkava tx bank send whale kava17fuj33p6y472j3kplsjdz966xlw6cdhwqzl8rl 1000000000ukava --gas-prices 0.01ukava -y
```

The above creates a new randomly generated account (`kava17fuj33p6y472j3kplsjdz966xlw6cdhwqzl8rl`) and funds it from the `whale` account.

For a list of available accounts see [accounts.json](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kvtool/blob/master/config/common/addresses.json), or the [keyring directory](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kvtool/tree/master/config/templates/kava/master/initstate/.kava/keyring-test).

Additionally, you can just exec into a shell in the container. Kvtool manages everything with docker-compose and it exposes a command that will run docker-compose in the required location. The running configuration is in `kvtool/full_configs/docker-compose.yaml`.

```
$ kvtool testnet dc -- exec kavanode bash

### Config Templates

Config templates control the initial genesis file used to start the network and contain the . They also include all the account keys for accounts configured in the docker container.

The available config templates can be found in [`config/templates/kava/`](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kvtool/tree/master/config/templates/kava).

By default, `kvtool` runs with the `master` config template which defaults to the `master` docker tag which is autodeployed whenever a commit is made to the master branch of `kava`. Occasionally, the configuration may become out of sync with what is currently on the master branch of kava. In these cases, it can be useful to use a template that uses a fixed docker tag with a working configuration:

For example, running a network with v0.21 of `kava`:

```
$ kvtool testnet bootstrap --kava.configTemplate v0.21
```

This won't be subject to changes breaking changes of `kava` that have yet to be updated in `kvtool`'s master template.

### Docker Image Tag

Additionally, all kava confiug templates support overriding the docker image tag. A full list of available tags is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/kava/kava/tags).

You can override the tag by setting the `KAVA_TAG` environment variable. For instance running the master template with a fixed kava version of `v0.21.0`:

```
KAVA_TAG=v0.21.0 kvtool testnet bootstrap
```

Note that at the time you're reading this, the master template's genesis and configuration may not be compatible with kava version v0.21.0.

This is also useful for the development of `kava` itself. You can build a docker image, give it a tag like `kava/kava:TAG_HERE`, and then run a local network with the built image. There is a shortcut for this in the `kava` repo.

```bash
cd kava
# the docker-build command builds the docker image and tags it `kava/kava:local`
make docker-build
# then you can run a network with the image you created
KAVA_TAG=local kvtool testnet bootstrap
```

## But wait! There's more!

`kvtool` has a lot more functionality than simply running a single local kava network. Be sure to use its `--help` command and check out the repo's [README.md](https://github.com/Kava-Labs/kvtool/blob/master/README.md).

It supports things like running two networks with an open IBC channel, chain upgrades, and more.

Be sure to check out our guide on [developing for Kava's EVM](../ethereum/development).

**Disclaimer**: `kvtool` is beta software. ðŸ˜Š Some of its features may not always work as expected. Generally, the commands used in this guide are frequently used enough to be reliable.
